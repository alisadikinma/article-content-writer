# Article Content Writer — Global Config

> Single source of truth for all configurable values. To change any setting, edit THIS file only.

---

## 1. Language

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| `primary_language` | Indonesian |
| `bilingual_support` | Yes — headline in primary language, subtitle as translation (configurable) |

| `default_framework` | PASO (Problem, Agitate, Solve, Outcome) | Most versatile for long-form — see frameworks-library.md |
| `article_length` | 1,900–2,400 words (default — template-specific ranges override this, e.g., Pillar Page 3,000-4,000, News Analysis 800-1,200) | SEO optimal per research: comprehensive guides rank higher [1] |
| `citation_density` | 1 data point or reputable citation per 400 words minimum | E-E-A-T signal density for search algorithms and AI Overviews [2] |
| `paragraph_max` | 3–4 lines | Scannability rule — more periods, fewer commas |

## 3. Hook Defaults

## 4. Forbidden Vocabulary

**DO NOT USE these words in any article:**

`Unlock` · `Unleash` · `Supercharge` · `Empower` · `Enhance` · `Exceed` · `Maximize`

**Why:** These are AI-sounding cliches that break conversational tone and signal machine-generated content. Use people-first, conversational language instead.

**Replacements:**
| Instead of | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Unlock your potential | Find what works for you |
| Unleash the power | Put it to work |
| Supercharge your workflow | Speed up your workflow |
| Empower your team | Give your team the tools |
| Enhance your results | Get better results |
| Maximize efficiency | Save more time |

| `actionable_depth` | Numbered points: minimum 150-250 words each with What + How + Example + Outcome structure |

### Cover Thumbnail Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|

| `cover_title` | Yes — article title rendered in-image, rule-of-thirds positioning, high contrast, bold sans-serif |
| `cover_subtitle` | Yes — max 8 words from article hook, below title, smaller font, contrasting background strip |
| `cover_composition` | YouTube thumbnail principles — max 3 focal points, readable at 320px width, high contrast |
| `cover_brand_logo` | From `reference_images.brand[]` via `file_urls` if available; skip entirely if no reference uploaded |

### Image Count by Article Length

| Article Length | Cover | Inline | Total |
|---------------|-------|--------|-------|
| Short (1,900 words) | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Standard (2,000–2,200 words) | 1 | 3 | 4 |
| Long (2,200–2,400+ words) | 1 | 4 | 5 |

### Reference Images

The `reference_images` object in the pipeline data contains uploaded assets for accurate rendering:

| Array | Purpose | Usage |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `face[]` | Face reference URLs for identity preservation | Pass via `file_urls` when generating images with specific people |
| `style[]` | Mood/style reference URLs | Pass via `file_urls` to guide overall aesthetic direction |
| `brand[]` | Brand logos and product visuals (**new**) | Pass via `file_urls` when image features a specific brand/product/tool. Identified by Context Extraction Gate in image-prompt-guide.md. Never hallucinate logos — if `brand[]` is empty, skip brand visuals entirely. |

### Physical Reality

All image prompts must comply with Physical Reality Constraints in `image-prompt-guide.md`. Key rules: screens face the user not the camera, objects obey gravity, reflections match scene geometry, human anatomy is correct. See the full constraint section for detailed rules and common AI failure patterns.
